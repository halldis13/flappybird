# HTML5 CSS-based Game

This game project has the following:

* 1024x768 pixel game canvas.
* All positions and sizes defined using a 10px em. This means that the game could be scaled up and down by changing the base font-size. This is one way to make the graphics responsive.
* A simple game loop which calculates delta and can be started and stopped.
* A player entity which can be moved around the canvas using the arrow keys.
* A "Game Over" screen when player is moved outside bounds, where the game can be restarted.

## Setup

```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

## TODO

* Other gameplay innovations are rated by the complexity of implementation.

### 100% done
* (5%) Gets one point for every gap that the player successfully passes.

* (10%) If a player loses he should see his score and a button which starts the game again.
* (10%) There should be a background element moving in paralax to the foreground, f.ex. a repeating cloud image. Note: it is not enough that the ground moves at different speed than the rest of the scene!

* (10%) Pipes and the ground slowly move to the left.
* (10%) If the player collides with the ground or a pipe, he loses instantly.
* (20%) The player character always stays in the same x position. Clicking space bar, clicking or tapping the screen makes the character jump up by a small amount, otherwise it falls down
* (10%) The character rotates into his direction. The player should either have a sprite animation or some element (like a wing) which animates when flapping. 

* (15% )Background music and sound effects for flapping and colliding. Mute support.
* (10%) All moving elements should be hardware accelerated.
